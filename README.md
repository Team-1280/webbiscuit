# Webbiscuit

Team 1280's state-of-the-art website. Hosts Team 1280's resources, information, and more.

## Development Instructions

The website is built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. To run a local development build:

Clone the repository:

```bash
# with https
git clone https://github.com/Team-1280/webbiscuit.git

# or with ssh
git clone git@github.com:Team-1280/webbiscuit.git

# or with GitHub CLI
gh repo clone Team-1280/webbiscuit

# and enter the directory
cd webbiscuit
```

Then, make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed, and then run the following to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start a development server by running:

```bash
# start the development server
pnpm dev
```

The development server will run at `localhost:5173`, and it will reload automatically on file changes or module updates. However, it won't be optimized for performance.

To test a local **production** build, run this instead:

```bash
# compile and bundle the site for production
pnpm build
# serve the production build in a local test server
pnpm preview
```

The preview server runs separately from the dev server at `localhost:4173`.
